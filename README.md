The game will display a square grid, with the columns
labeled with letters, and the rows with numbers.
Elements within the grid will be associated with pairs
of integers (a pair of 0’s, and pair or 1’s, a pair of 2’s,
etc.). Initially, we will not be able to see any of the
numbers, as they will be hidden by ‘X’ symbols. Your
job as a player is to find the hidden pairs in as few
guesses as possible. A simple menu will allow you to
interact with the game as below:

1. Let me select two elements
2. Uncover one element for me
3. I give up - reveal the grid
4. New game
5. Exit
